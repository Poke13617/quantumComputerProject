    <div class="halfW"> This project will be about quantum computers. A quantum computer is a device that functions differently from reading ones and zeroes. Instead of reading ones and zeroes, they look at the possible outcomes for both.</div>     <!--1/2  Width (content) This will be the start of the page, explaining quickly what a quantum computer is-->
    
    <div class="halfW21">Quantum computers are not very cost-effective, so the average human can't own a quantum computer (yet).</div>     <!--2/2  Width (an image about a quantum computer) No extra info-->
    
    <div class="fW1">How Much Does a Quantum Computer Cost to Build?</div>       <!--Full Width(Fun fact + 3 sentence in-depth explanation)  There will be borders on the top and bottom of the site. This is also just before the next section-->
    
    <div class="halfW2"></div>     <!--1/2  Width (Nothing will be on the other side for now)-->
    
    <div class="halfW">The average quantum computer can cost from tens of millions to even billions of dollars as some of the parts such as qubits and cryogenic coolers cost up to millions depending on the quality.</div>     <!--2/2  Width. This will be text this time, it will zig zag for the content -->
    
    <div class="fW2">Here is a fun fact: Quantum Computers are the most dangerous weapons nowadays. they are the most dangerous as more people are online doing important tasks when comparing it to the amount of people in buildings. Attacking personal data online is a lot more malicious than breaking in to someone's house.</div>       <!--Full Width, this is The last fun fact about them.-->
