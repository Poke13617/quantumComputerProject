    //These divs will have 1/5 different Classes, those being introbox, 1/2W , 2/2W , Intro, Footer, or FW
    <div class="introBox"></div> //Intro, the titlecard (This will show up covering the page, slowly fading away.)
    <div class="point1_1/2W"></div>     //1/2  Width (content) This will be the start of the page, explaining quickly what a quantum computer is
    <div class="2/2W"></div>     //2/2  Width (an image about a quantum computer) No extra info
    <div class="fW"></div>       //Full Width(Fun fact + 3 sentence in-depth explanation)  There will be borders on the top and bottom of the site. This is also just before the next section
    <div class="point2_1/2W"></div>     //1/2  Width (Nothing will be on the other side for now)
    <div class="2/2W"></div>     //2/2  Width. This will be text this time, it will zig zag for the content 
    <div class="fW"></div>       //Full Width, this is The last fun fact about them.
    <div class="fW"></div>       //Full Width, more space for content
    <div class="footerBox"></div>//Footer, the bottom of the page, another place where the links will be. The site will not have a sticky menu on top, it will change it's state of visibility when the site is scrolled up.
/*Pages 2-5 will be as follows:
2 - How quantum computers can take information that we can't even compute on our most modern non-quantum computers
3 - What is required for a quantum computer to function
4 - What companies use them, and how they use them
5 - What other experiments were like quantum computing
